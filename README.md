CampusDwar
📚 Description
The College ERP System is a comprehensive management tool designed to streamline and automate academic and administrative processes in colleges. It provides distinct roles for HODs (Heads of Departments), Professors, and Students, each with specific functionalities. The system is built using modern technologies with a robust backend and an interactive frontend, ensuring efficiency and user-friendliness.

“CampusDwar is a three-tier web application with React on the frontend, Spring Boot on the backend, and MySQL as the database.
The frontend is a Single Page Application that uses React Router, Redux for state, and Axios for API calls. The backend is a REST API built using Spring Boot with role-based access control. All data is stored in MySQL, while media files are stored in Firebase.
The architecture follows clean separation: UI at frontend, business logic at backend, and persistence in database + cloud storage.”
